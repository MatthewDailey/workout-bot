# Workout Bot

This project is a server for Messenger Platform built in Node.js. With this app, you can send it messages and it will echo them back to you.

It contains the following functionality:

* Webhook (specifically for Messenger Platform events)
* Send API 
* Web Plugins
* Messenger Platform v1.1 features

Follow the [walk-through](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) to learn about this project in more detail.

## Setup

Set the values in `config/default.json` before running the sample. Descriptions of each parameter can be found in `app.js`. Alternatively, you can set the corresponding environment variables as defined in `app.js`.

Replace values for `APP_ID` and `PAGE_ID` in `public/index.html`.

## Run

Use localtunnel for local development. Run `. ./devStart.sh` and put the callback url in the [app settings](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/206915126423502/webhooks/)

You can start the server by running `npm start`. However, the webhook must be at a public URL that the Facebook servers can reach. Therefore, running the server locally on your machine will not work.


## Webhook

All webhook code is in `app.js`. It is routed to `/webhook`. This project handles callbacks for authentication, messages, delivery confirmation and postbacks. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference).

## "Send to Messenger" and "Message Us" Plugin

An example of the "Send to Messenger" plugin and "Message Us" plugin are located at `index.html`. The "Send to Messenger" plugin can be used to trigger an authentication event. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/plugin-reference).
